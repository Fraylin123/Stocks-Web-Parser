A web parser that parses Yahoo's Finance Most Active Stocks page (https://finance.yahoo.com/markets/stocks/most-active/) to get the 25 most active stocks and displays them in a table on an Apache web server using PHP. The Python script uses get requests, BeautifulSoup for parsing, and pymongo to add the extracted data to a MongoDB database. The PHP script reads the data from the MongoDB database and displays the data in a table on an Apache web server.
